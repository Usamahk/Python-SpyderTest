## Repo containing all files used in testing and loading Python 3.5 on Spyder. 

Will be doing all tests from Probabalistic Programming and Bayesian Thinking for Hackers by Cam Davidosn Pilon and updating packages and libraries accordingly. Most code is my interpretation of the excerises in the book or copied directlly where applicable. I am doing so to further my personal knowledge in Python. Will be updating this frequently

The book can be found here:- https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers
